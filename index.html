<H1>Welcome to Hackerfleet's developer homepage!</H1>

<p>We develop opensource hardware and software for unmanned and manned vessels
on all waters. We develop publicly and transparent, our repositorys are open
for you.</p>

<p>We aim to establish a better communication network between
compatible hardware, for automatic data exchange between ships.</p>

<p>We want to aggregate all the information that is currently thrown away on
shipbridges all over the world and use it, to make the best free map of the ocean.</p>

<p>This vast ressource of currently nearly unused data will also help
scientists understand our oceans better.</p>

<p><b>Until we find a nice design for this developer landing page, please just
<a href="https://github.com/hackerfleet/">head over to our
repositories.</a></p>
